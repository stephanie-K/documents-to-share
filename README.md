## Accessibility
![Accessibility word the first and last letter of the word in black and the letters in between in red and numbered. There are 11 letters between the initial 'a' and the last 'y', that's why we say a11y](a11y/a11y-CYF.png)

## Zoom help

I created basic documents to guide people when they are new to Zoom

### For phone:
- The [**Google doc**](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DIc5Q4apBMB1hGo-LUPMM9ivo_Rm3oVNr3d1u30RroU/edit?usp=sharing), so you can copy it and make changes to it if you want to.

**Some PDFs**
- [Join Zoom on a phone](/Zoom/Join_Zoom_on_a_phone.pdf)
- [Zoom functions on a phone](/Zoom/Zoom_functions_on_a_phone.pdf)
- [Join a Zoom breakout room on a phone](/Zoom/Join-Zoom-breakout-room-on-a-phone.pdf)

**Videos mades using the Google doc**
You have the files in the Zoom folder here. They are also on Youtube
